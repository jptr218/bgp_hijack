### Alastor is a tool similar to [Athena](https://github.com/jptr218/athena), which redirects packets leaving other networks, making use of [BGP hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking). It requires the [WinPCap Network Driver](https://www.winpcap.org/default.htm) to run.
## Alastor can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jptr218/alastor/raw/main/alastor.exe) (you will need to run it from the command line)
### Usage:

### `alastor [target] [old destination] [new destination] `
